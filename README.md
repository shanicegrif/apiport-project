# Api Profolio Project
This project uses a Ricky and Morty api, that has a total of 826 characters sorted by their id. Each one of the character objects includes information on that character existance within the show such as name gender, origin, episodes they appeared in and so on. However, this project only utilizes 3 different aspects of that object and return that character(s) for the user to see.

### *Form Instructions:*
- There are two separate forms that are on the Character Guide page. However the user is only allowed to submit one of the forms.
- The first form will search for a single character by their id. 
- The second form will filter through the characters either by their name, living status or both criteria. This may return multiple characters.
- The result of the form will return character(s) information such as name, gender, species, origin, and living status.

### *Form Features:*
There are some special features to the name section of the second form. This part of the form will filter through the character based on the partcial name inputed by the user. It will then return all the charcters who name includes that sub-text.

### Stretch Goals:
- Used some transition on :hover selector of the two links that are shown on each page.
