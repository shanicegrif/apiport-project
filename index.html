            <p class="sum">The world that these two characters occupy is a part of a multiverse. This means there are an infinite number of universes with copies of themselves that exist in time, all of whom are different. However, in some way this duo and all that exist of them seem to be the center of everything as seen through the creation of the Citadel. However, along the way they bump into many other characters that aren't themselves.</p>
