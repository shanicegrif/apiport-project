            <h3>Understanding the Rick and Mory Universe</h3>
            <p>The world that these two characters occupy is apart of a multiverse. This mean there are an infinite number of universes with copies of themselves that exist in time, all of whom are different. However, in is some way this duo and all that exist of them seem to be the center of everything as seen through the creation the Citadel. However, along the way they bump into many other characters that aren't themselves.</p>

            <p>Do you want to learn more about the different characters that exist. There are two separate forms that are on the Character Guide page. However the you are only allowed to submit one of the forms. The first form will search for a single character by their id. The second form will filter through the characters either by their name, living status or both criteria. This may return multiple characters. The result of the form will return character(s) information such as name, gender, species, origin, and living status. There are also some special features to the name section of the second form. This part of the form will filter through the character based on the partcial name inputed by the user. It will then return all the charcters who name includes that sub-text.</p>
